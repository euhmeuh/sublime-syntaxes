# sublime-syntaxes
A collection of syntax highlighting definitions for esoteric languages

Those syntaxes are compatible with any editor supporting the SublimeSyntax format.  
To name a few: [Amp](https://github.com/jmacdonald/amp), any project using [Syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect), and of course SublimeText.
